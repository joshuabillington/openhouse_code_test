If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? Would you implement anything differently?

1. Add state management via redux. Add reducer/saga and seperate out queries and data processing from index.tsx. 
2. Use either emotion.js or sass for styling. 
3. Add better error handling. 
4. Improve responsive design. 

To run project:

In dev mode: 
yarn dev 
or npm run dev 

In production mode: 
yarn build 
yarn start 

Project is built with Next.js to utilize server side rendering to create a fast application. Also using react-bootstrap.
