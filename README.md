If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? Would you implement anything differently?

1. Add state management via redux. Add reducer/saga and seperate out queries and data processing from index.tsx. 
2. Use either emotion.js or sass for styling. 
3. Add better error handling. 
4. Improve responsive design.
